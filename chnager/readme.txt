I have done this aassignment using dom manipulation.
first i have created the drop down for color,bg-color, padding,font size and font weight using html.
Then i have get that dropdown element by their ID and store that in a variable.
Then i add a onchange event listener to all the variable.
Then using that value i manipulate the style of the changer div.

thank you.
