# catchme README

## Overview

This HTML document contains a simple interactive button game. When you load the HTML file in a web browser, you'll see a button labeled "catch me." The button will move to a random position on the screen when you hover your mouse over it, challenging you to catch it.



## Code Structure

The HTML file is structured as follows:

- It defines an HTML5 document with a `<head>` section containing metadata and a `<body>` section where the game interface is created.

- The CSS code inside the `<style>` tags defines the styling for the button. It sets the button's appearance and positioning.

- The JavaScript code inside the `<script>` tag adds interactivity to the button. When the mouse hovers over the button, it changes the button's position to a random location on the screen.
