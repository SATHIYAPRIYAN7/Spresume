# Emoji Searching Application

## Overview

This is a simple web application that allows users to search for emojis based on their aliases or tags. The application features a user interface with a search bar, a "Search" button, and a results container. Users can enter a search term, click the "Search" button, or type in the search bar to find matching emojis. The matching emojis are displayed below the search bar.

## Code Structure

The code consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components:

1. **CSS Styles**:
   - CSS styles are defined within the `<style>` tags at the beginning of the code. These styles set the appearance of various elements on the page, including fonts, colors, and layout.

2. **HTML Structure**:
   - The HTML structure is used to create the layout of the web page. Key elements include:
     - A main container with the class "main" that holds the application's content.
     - An `<h1>` heading displaying "Emoji Searching Application."
     - A horizontal line `<hr>` for visual separation.
     - A search section with an input field and a "Search" button.
     - A `div` element with the id "searchResultContainer" to display search results.

3. **JavaScript Functionality**:
   - The JavaScript code provides the application's functionality. Key features include:
     - Selecting HTML elements using `getElementById`.
     - Defining a `searchEmoji` function to filter and display emojis based on user input.
     - Event listeners for the "Search" button and input field to trigger the `searchEmoji` function.
     - Populating the "searchResultContainer" with matching emojis.

## Usage

To use the Emoji Searching Application:

1. Open the HTML file (containing the provided code) in a web browser.
2. Enter a search term in the input field.
3. Click the "Search" button or press Enter in the input field.
4. Matching emojis will be displayed below the search bar in the "searchResultContainer."



- The code assumes the existence of a variable named `emojiList` that contains a list of emojis with aliases, tags, emojis, descriptions, and categories. Ensure that this variable is properly defined and populated with emoji data for the application to function correctly.

- The application automatically calls the `searchEmoji` function when the page loads, so initial emoji data will be displayed.
