first i have created the text input box and one button using html.
Then i have get the those elements by their ids and stored in a variable.
Then initaialise a empty array and the push the value in a input box while clicking the button.
Then get the elements one by one by using for loops and then stored in a variable in html format.
Then append that variable values in the empty div using innerhtml.


thank you
